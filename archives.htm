Schema for PHPLIB Web Development</A>
<TD>A Libero schema for PHPLIB, developed by Bernard de Rubinat, based on
Attilio's PHP schema.  Provides a framework for web development using Libero
and PHP.

Single-stepped Schema for Visual Basic</A>
<BR>v1.0
<TD>An alternative VB schema for Libero which lets you handle
user-interface events as they occur.  Lets you write VB dialog
programs that truly interact with the user interface.

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="pattern.tgz">
Libero schema to generate state patterns</A>
<BR>v0.4
<TD>An alternative C++ schema for Libero that directly generates state
patterns, instead of using the conventional dialog tables.  Includes
documentation in various formats.  Requires Libero 2.30 or later.
Written by <A HREF="mailto:mathias@weidner.sem.lipsia.de">Mathias
Weidner.</A>  He says: <I>
"Most of the files in the tar file can be generated from the noweb source
(lrpattern.nw). Since not all will have noweb, LaTeX and dvips installed,
I've put the LaTeX source and the PostScript file into the archive. And the
schema too.  For demonstration purposes I've included a simple dialog and a
C++ main file to play with. This example may also be generated from
lrpattern.nw and is explained in the doc. It's tested under Linux with gcc.
You may look in the Makefile.in how to make it."

Libero schema to generate graphical documentation</A>
<BR>v0.1
<TD>An alternative schema for Libero that directly graphical documentation
from a Libero dialog.  Includes documentation in various formats.  Written
by <A HREF="mailto:mathias@weidner.sem.lipsia.de"> Mathias Weidner.</A>  He
says: <I>
"This schema is for drawing state graphs from Libero dialogs. I use a tool
called <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/orgs/ssr/book/reuse">dot</A> for
this that I've found under Graph Visualization at www.research.att.com. It's
not free for commercial purposes but I don't want to sell this since everyone
may download it there. Just have a look at the PostScript file enclosed in
the archive [lrdot.ps]. You can make drawings that contain all events or omit
those events that do not cause state changes. The latter form is easier to
read for a short walk through the state graph. The first form is for
completeness. The .tex (and the .nw) files show how to include those drawings
in some documentation."

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="//github.com/imatix-legacy/srcdoc/">Srcdoc</A>
<BR>v1.52
<TD>This tool generates documentation in HTML format from C source
files.  The source code needs to keep to some conventions.  We use
this to generate the documentation for SFL, SMT, and our other libraries.
This tool is best suited to source libraries.  Requires Perl 4 or 5.

<TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="//github.com/imatix-legacy/framer/">Framer</A>
<BR>v1.1
<TD>Generates a HTML hyperview of a Libero source program and dialog.
This is a very convenient way to browse the source code; we use this
to generate part of the documentation for products like SMT.
Works with any language.  Requires Perl 4 or 5.

<BR>v2.10
<TD>Generates multiplatform compile/build scripts from a single source.
We use this to build the build scripts for our various products.
Produces scripts for UNIX, OS/2, MS-DOS.  Requires Perl 4 or 5.
