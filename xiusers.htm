Hi there!<BR>
As a die-hard Xitami user since 1995, I can say that I've never been
disapointed by it's performances or features. Xitami has proven to be THE
best webserver for windows NT because of it's flexibility, simplicity and
ease-of-use... It's well worth the try.  Thanks!

All of the hard workers there at iMatix have created a wonderful program
in Xitami!  It's so easy to set up and use, I couldn't believe it!  The
amount of configuration possible is amazing!  And it's free!  Who could
want anything more?  
I use it as a personal server for testing CGI scripts and web sites
before posting them to the Internet.  I refused to pay for a server when
I knew how the Internet community was!  So after some searching, and
trying a few different servers, some free, some shareware, I stumbled
across Xitami.  Am I glad I kept searching!  Keep up the good work!
</I><BR>

Your web server is incredible.  It is small, fast, and feature packed!
The integrated FTP server blows the socks off any competition.  Keep up
the great work!

Unbelievable. I ran Micro$oft's 'Personal Web Server' for the longest time.
I had always had problems, but it was free and relatively easy to install.
I just searched on www.winfiles.com for a web server app and yours was
displayed. I tried it out and it's now replaced MSPWS!! What an excellent
product. How you can offer it for free is beyond me.

Thank you for wonderful free product. We are starting our small company
intranet and have come to choose Xitami after having tested Apache, Netscape
and MS. We use Xitami on NT with PHP 3 and Sybase SQL Anywhere, and also
consider a project with LRWP + Python, and moving it all to Linux. I had no
problems installing and learning Xitami, performance is great, configuration
is one of the simplest. Good luck, and once more thank you.

Just to let you know Xitami is performing flawlessly serving a site that an
hour after its inception is receiving 25 to 30 raw hits [including image
loads, etc] per second!  This site is

Wow. It's been years since I've seen a product that even registers on the
Wow Scale. (Jaded? Me?) But the Xitami Web server is just plain
astonishing... I'm impressed. 618 K; it's free; it's fast; and in about 20
minutes, I've gone from no server to Web server -- with enough time left
over to wander around and say "Wow" more times than an alpha-geek wannabe
would ordinarily admit to. Bill Gates, eat your heart out.

hi, i just wanted to let you guys know that your products are really
outstanding.. i very rarely feel compelled to write anyone and
compliment them, but i can't help it.. i've only been using the Xitami
web server a few weeks, but it's the best i've seen so far.. i haven't
been able to really get too involved with your other products yet, but
i'm anxious to. thanks again,

Many thanks for the incredible Xitami server! I use the NT Service version
on a 486/100mHz/48mbRAM machine with NT 4.0 and I couldn't be happier! To me
performance is the most important aspect of a web server. Xitami not only
fills that criteria, it is incredibly easy to install too. And on top of all
that, it's free!  Thanks again!
</I><BR>

<P><I>
What I like most about Xitami is that it's easy to handle. Nothing outside
Xitami's directory, no "setup is updating your system" (which scares the
hell out of me each time). Amazing! No DLLs in the 'system32'-directory, and
no registering of OLE components. No need to reboot after installing! I've
got the strong impression that I can rely on the fact that it will never
crash my computer or prevent me from running other applications, as opposed
to certain other products of vendors that shall remain nameless. Actually
I've got the suspicion you've never used the MFC wizard :-)  This is quite
surprising nowadays, and I encourage you to keep it that way. Thanks again
for your great product.

I would like to thank you for Xitami - it's both the smallest and fastest
web server I've looked at. It runs flawlessly on our OS/2 server and was the
easiest server install I've done. In a few days, it will be one of the
primary web servers in our company.

I'm just a typical computer technician who works magic on ill mannered
computers. And I happen to delve into web page designing during my off time
at home. We have a lot of documentation that was just put into electronic
form, and I thought about publishing it on our internal network, but in
order to take full advantage of a web based system, I needed a Web Server
product for my web pages I publish on our network. So I did my hunt for web
servers, and found your unbeatable, and outstanding web server product
"Xitami". I personally have to say it RULES! Plus you can't beat the price
of FREE. I've looked at other products some ranging around $100 - $300, but
this product kicks all the competition butts. And I just love the
"ready-to-run-outta-the-box" feature. The only other thing I had to do was
drag-n-drop my CGI scripts into an appropriate folder i created for them,
and change the CGI location in the HTML files. So I have to say, YOU guys
outdone yourselves on this product. Congrats to you, and everyone that made
this product a WINNER! Keep up the good work.

Hi! I'd like to become known to the world (and you...) as a happy user of
Xitami. It's cool. I like it. It's faster and more convenient than anything
I've seen before serving the web. period. Go on making cool stuff. Greetings
from Hamburg, Germany.

I first used Xitami for the evaluation of my company's web site. They loved
it. Sadly they had already purchased a virtual domain, and the site was
moved there. We still use Xitami for all of our internal web services, and
technical support department. With a free account from Monolith we are able
to keep our service department available to the public 24 hours a day. I
loved the stability of Xitami so much that I installed it on one of my
network win95 boxes at home. It now runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and
hasn't had an error yet. This program beat out the NT4.0 IIS server that I
ran for a short time. I still use another 3rd party ftp server, but only
because I have everything already set up there. Thanks for creating such a
great product. After years of "bumming" lines of code from my own programs
and scripts, I could never top this incredible program, and all its
functions with the small footprint that it has. WOW!

I'd like to thank you and the whole iMatix crew for all the wonderful work
you have been doing. I LOVE Xitami and I love that you take the time to
reply to users of the mailing list (very detailed and timely -- thanks
again). I'm a college student right now and current can't afford Xitami Pro,
but I'm looking forward to supporting you guys after I graduate. I have alot
of faith in Xitami, and it's always a great pleasure to hear others say
"This program kicks! I'm uninstalling Apache and installing this on my linux
box". I look forward to showing more people your great product. It's the
easiest and fastest webserver I have used in both Windows 95 and Linux.
You guys are the greatest, and I can't thank you enough.

I just wanted to tell you that your product is GREAT!  I'm a teacher who
uses the 'Net as a repository for course notes, news briefs, and other
sources of info on career counseling information systems.  I had to install
a quick and dirty solution on our intranet for my own needs, and your
product performed even better than what I expected (which was a lot, BTW!).
Lastly, performance is truly awesome, even on a low-end Pentium system with
Win95 connected to a Netware 4.x server.  I had 60 students tonight work
together and the server worked A-1!  Keep up the good work!

Xitami is an excellent program! I've been using it for over a year now
(sorry for the late registration!) and I am quite satisfied. Xitami is, by
far, the best webserver available for Windows 9x, and it stacks up very well
against others available for Unix and NT. And it's free! You guys must be
some kind of saints.

Great Job Team!  I used to use IIS4 on my PII NT Server, not any more.
I think the thing that sold me, apart from the speed, was the filter 
support. All of my web apps require serious code somewhere and I was
looking for a 'cleaner' web server than IIS which supported that.
I gave up on ASP a while back and now I've chucked IIS as well. I'm not
anti-microsoft or anti-IIS, I just think Xitami is much better.
Faster, Easier to Configure, More *Understandable* Docs .. why go back??
Thanks for a great product. !

WOW!!!!! This is awesome! I have MS personal web server but never use it
because it's kind of a pain to keep going without any challenges. Xitami is
an outstanding program because all I needed to do was run the win32.exe file
and instantly I had my own web server online! It blew me away when I ran
MSIE to see if I could really connect to my new Xitami web server. It was
really online just by running the .exe file! No set ups, no hassles. Just
that easy. 
<BR>
I've no idea why you folks have released such an awesome program for free,
but I'm glad you did! Because until now I've been using a business host
which requires that I put their banners on each html page or pay $$$
monthly in order to use their services. Not that I mind reciprocating but
their banner ads cripple all of my cgi scripts which include framesets :(   
Now for me, I can avoid that frustration as well as avoid the high cost of
renting a primary server just to run a few cgi scripts.
<BR>
Thank you very very much!

Using Xitami to build my company's intranet was a breeze.  It took only
a few moments and our web server was running smoothly (FTP too!).  Thanks

I'm still trying to figure out if I'm dreaming. Xitami is everything it
promises to be. And free?!?!?! That's the icing on the cake! This thing
couldn't be easier to use. Within minutes of installing it, I was
viewing the help and admin stuff from my browser on a different machine.
I copied over a site of mine, and it worked flawlessly. I was impressed
that you already had RealAudio in the MIME config, as I use it on my
site. In another few minutes I was using FTP. WOW! 
Oh... and just FYI, I'm running Xitami on a 396-40 with 20MB of RAM
under Win95. True, it's an antique by today's standards, but it was
something I cobbled together. The fact that Xitami runs so well on it is
a real credit to you.

Just converted to using Xitami for OS/2 from Goserve. It only took about
30mins or so to get my website fully functional again (setting up aliases
etc.). It was a breeze to install, I was surprised how intuitive it was.
Without any docs and looking up some config files, I was quickly able to
grasp how Xitami works and get it up and running. Not only that, it is
really FAST! It was also efficient in it's use of CPU resources. 
To test it out I had several users browse the pages with each of them also 
streaming an MP3 file at 128k per second through our campus network. Only the 
hard drive whirring and a few microscopic peaks on the CPU meter were 
indicators that there were several people connected. I look forward to finding 
out more about its features.

I have been using Xitami on my PII233 box w/ 64 MB for a month. Since I don't
receive a large number of hits at the moment, I couldn't find opportunity to
test its limits. However Xitami's easy and high configurability really impressed
me. Xitami support a lot of useful features, which most of the commercial server
software cannot handle efficiently. SMALL + FAST + EASY + POWERFUL +  ... =>
EXCELLENT!!!  Thanks a lot for this great product.

I absolutely have to say this - Xitami is GREAT!!!  I have a record of 68

WONDERFUL web server. I am a webmaster at work and I run it on my P166 on
our intranet. My boss can watch me work "hot" on the current site. My
computer can't support the whole company...but I can show the site to anyone
on our hundreds of servers (handy for getting the site approved). I also use
it personally everytime I log into the internet
(http://www.west.net/~mjburns/upload.htm) and if the Unix version will work
on a Linux box, we are going to use it for The Santa Barbara PC Users Group
site when we can afford a full time connect.  Best wishes, and thank you
very very much.

Hi - I've been trying out the various freeware servers for Win95 for some
time now, and I keep coming back to Xitami. I've just recommended it to my
third-year students as their best bet in a development web server.. I just
deleted the Microsoft PWS - great server, ASP is cool, but it ate my laptop
whole and has no authentication ability on Win95. Xitami takes no noticeable
resources and it's just so fast. Unlike Sambar, getting Python CGIs to run
was a snap. I really like the way you point CGI scripts at the executable as
on Unix, because it means I can run both the ActiveState and the regular
versions of Perl when I need to. Cheers on a great product.

I've been looking for a web server for quite some time and I ran across
many of which were bloated and did not do as advertised.  Then while
keeping my hopes up that something was out there that would work I came
across Xitami.  I thought to myself only a couple 100Ks for a web
server?!?  Could not possibly work!! Yet I decided to download it and
give it a try.  I must say that I'm glad that I did.  I run it on a P133
Win95 machine with a mere 28.8 connection and it easily handles 10-20,
possibly more due to no serious load testing, visitors simultaneously!!
Thank you for making such a great product that is affordable and easy to
use!

Kudos on an excellent product. For our discussion board program, Discus, we
are now recommending Xitami as our #1 choice for a freeware web server on
Windows 95. Among other products we reviewed (OmniHTTPd, Microsoft PWS,
Apache, Sambar, Fnord, ...), your server was equally easy to set up and a
breeze to configure, but it stood out above the rest in terms of
attractiveness while running (a task tray icon and administrator
functionality that actually work!), speed (especially CGIs), and CGI
setup/perl association. We are pleased to endorse your server with our
customers -- and we have noticed that several of our customers have
installed your product and our discussion board software and are now happily
using it.

I downloaded and tested your little server - terrific! I'm trying to learn
CGI/perl, and I'm using the server locally to test scripts. Xitami is the

I have used Xitami in the past (2.0e), and am about to run the latest 
(2.2b). I must say, after running MS Personal Web Server 1.0a & 4.0, MS
IIS 2.0 - 4.0, O'Reilly WebSite 1.1e, and Apache (latest Linux version),
I have found that Xitami outperforms all of them. I do regret that it 
doesn't have FrontPage Server Extensions, but hopefully soon that will 
change. For the FTP Server since 2.0e, I didn't quite like the limited 
configurability of it, but it is a good shot for combining both HTTPD 
and FTPD in one power-packed package!<BR>
One thing I would like to see is for GUI-based users, is to have a GUI
Configurator, not Web-Based, but a graphical front-end, much like 
O'Reilly WebSite has.

I'd like to write about your product, Xitami webserver. It is excellent.
Fast speed performance and multiplatform. I run a Windows 95 p233 box and
Linux 2.0.30 p200 box. Both run Xitami. I used to use my Windows 95 system a
lot as a webserver and Xitami was useful. It did not lag up my sys, I could
do whatever I want while it was running. CGI is excellent. I like that the
server is freeware. You have saved my life with your product. Also Xitami is
very much built like another exelent but less comfortable server Apache. It
can fetch pages at speeds higher then the normal internet connection. I love
your product. Keep up with such work!

I would like to say that it is my opinion that your Xitami

After trying out another free web server, I was almost convinced that there
couldn't be a good free web server, and was about to switch back to IIS when
I came across Xitami. To put it simply - within about 5 minutes I had
installed Xitami, told it what I wanted it to do, and it went about doing it
(darned well I might add!). Congratulations on making such a fine piece of
software, and thanks for making it so affordable!

I must say you have done it again with Xitami 2.0e. Extremely stable,
easy to use and set up. (even better with the web-based admin...) With

I tried ALL the freeware and shareware and demos of servers for Win95.
This is for certain the easiest to use - can run it "straight out of the

Now includes FTP also, and it too can be run as is or tweaked. They do
answer Email - and fast.

an ISP, I'm seriously considering using this server to replace the current
IIS 3.0 system after more tests have been done to ensure stability and
responsiveness - all of which it's passed so far :)

Just wanted to drop you folks a line about your WebServer.
We are a new Internet presence provider setting up on the Net for the
first time. We tried every version of "free" server out there, and a few
commercial ones. Your software is the fastest, easiest server we have
found! Thanks for a great product! So far it has worked flawlessly on
our our win95 based, 133Mhz, 64mb Ram, server machine. We will soon be
migrating to NT server, but have already decided to run Xitami Server.
I just installed v1.3b tonite and was amazed at how well it worked!
Great stuff guys!

Thank you for such a great web server. It is the smallest, fastest, and
most covenient web server I've used so far.

My company is putting together a web demo that is being developed on
Unix, but need to run under WNT/W95 as well.  I got the chore of sorting
out the differences.  Our developers develop around Apache 1.2.  I chose
Xitami as our W95/NT server mainly because of its small footprint.
Xitami, perl 5.003 for W95/NT, and all our pages can fit on one floppy
easily.

I recently tried Xitami 1.2b, and really liked it a lot better than my
current server (Fnord)--especially the speed and the format of the log
file.  Congratulations on a very nice product!

I happened across your website while browsing the No-nags repository
for a web server.  I not only found exactly what I was looking for
with Xitami, but I was blown away to the point of inspiration by all
the outstanding offerings on your site... and all of it with the
source code included!!!  The elegance of your designs makes the
mystique of portability seem trival... and cross platform design is
an art that sometimes seems completely lost to many of the software
development houses churning out "Windows only" apps these days.
I'm looking forward to exploring your libero tool as it focuses well
needed attention on the DESIGN phase that so many SW engineers blow
through all too quickly... myself included!
Thanks again for your generous contributions... they, and the
talented people behind them such as yourself are greatly appreciated
and make the internet world a lot brighter and more productive place!

This is an excellent program and better than any other server I've found!

I just wanted to complement you.  With every newsletter that comes out,
and every update that comes out, I'm always amazed.  Seldom is an
excellent product built for free, and is as loved, cared for, and
maintained as well as Xitami.  I prefer its use over any other shareware
or freeware server, and I've yet to find a commercial system with enough
advantages to draw me to it instead.  Congradulations on a most
excellent product, and I hope it continues to be as good as ever!

Looks like a nice job you did on the server.  And, I can definitely say
that you are the fastest tech-support I've seen for webservers.  I'm on
week 3 of a tech support issue with another webserver company.

I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for offering Xitami web
server, especially for free!  It is an excellent product.  I have spent
the last 2 weeks researching web servers for Windows NT 4.0 for my
company.  Our primary concern is speed.  My own in-house tests showed
Xitami to be MUCH faster than other web servers, especially the NT
Service version.  Xitami was setup on a Pentium 166MHz, 64MB RAM & Windows
NT 4.0.  The internet connection being a T1, but also accessible from our
100MB intranet.  With Xitami also serving via the T1, it maintained approx.
790  kb/sec. rate to my workstation over the 100MB intranet. Comparatively,
OmniHTTPd maintained around 400 kb/sec. and W4 Server around 370 kb/sec
rates.  All tests were done using a 50MB file.  The only difference is that
Xitami was *ALSO* serving the T1 connection at the same time, the other
programs were not!  Amazing... to say the least.  Anyway, I've made my
choice.  :)

I really love your webserver. It is small and powerful.

Wonderful !!!
I think this is great. I tried to break this but could not. The speed is
fabulous. It is much better than any other webserver, including ISAPI and
NSAPI.  Thanks Pieter and all those who are in your team or helping you.
This is a killer product and needs lots of visibility.

I've been looking for a web server for a while which runs the same
config under Windows & OS/2 as on my unix boxes.  This is primarily to
use my laptop to demo stuff created on the unix boxes.  The problem was
that nothing quite supported virtual hosts, seamless CGI, and was easy
and solid.  Xitami is all of these and has saved me considerable time
and effort.

After trying on my Windows95 PC many server programs, plagued with GPF's,
bugs, incompatiblities, and other "undescribeable" configuration problems, I
came upon your site. Thanks for a great product!, and most of all (Sorry, I
have to scream this so everybody can hear it)
<BR>THANKS FOR A PRODUCT THAT DOES WHAT IT SAYS!! (with no ifs)
